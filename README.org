#+TITLE: Wire Cell Interface to TBB flow graph

* Nodes

TBB [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/tbb_userguide/Predifined_Node_Types.htm#predefined_node_types][node types]]:

- =source_node= :: ( [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/flow_graph/source_node_cls.htm][ref]] [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/tbb_userguide/use_source_node.htm][ex]] ) takes body object, activation
- =function_node= :: ( [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/flow_graph/func_node_cls.htm][ref]] [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/tbb_userguide/Nodes.htm][ex]] ) takes body object, concurrency limit, buffered input by default.
- =multifunction_node= :: ( [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/flow_graph/multifunc_node_cls.htm][ref]] ) templated, =typedef= on in/out types.  Out is a =tbb::flow::tuple= which is a =std::tuple=, takes a body which is given a collection of output ports into which it may put actual output.
- =composite_node= :: ( [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/flow_graph/composite_node_cls.htm][ref]] ) N-to-M external ports encapsulating a sub-graph of internal nodes
- =join_node= :: ( [[https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/docs/help/reference/flow_graph/join_node_cls.htm][ref]] ) queued input (by default), sends tuple

Every TBB Node has 

- number and types of input ports
- number and types of output ports

TBB Body has

- calling signature
